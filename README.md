# Europa-Clipper packet definitions

For instruments ECM, MISE and SUDA, some of the CCSDS packets definitions are coded here, as needed by the Science Data System.

Those packet definitions are used by the [SPaC-kit CCSDS library](https://github.com/CCSDSPy/SPAC-kit) to decode CCSDS packets, generate documentation and simulated datasets.

## Prerequisites

This package has been tested with Python 3.9.

## Users


TO BE DONE (deploy from pypi, link to SPaC-kit for usage...)


## Developers

Clone the repository:

    git clone  https://github.com/joshgarde/europa-cliper-ccsds-plugin.git

Create a virtual environment and activate it:

    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

You might need to upgrade pip first:

    pip install --upgrade pip

If you want to use the latest dev version of spac-kit, install it from the sources:

     git clone https://github.com/CCSDSPy/SPaC-Kit.git
     source {HOME OR PATH TO YOUR VENV}/bin/activate
     pip install ./SPaC-Kit

Install the package in editable mode, with the developer dependencies:

    pip install -e '.[dev]'

Or use poetry:

    pip install poetry
    poetry lock
    poetry install --with dev


IMPORTANT: Install the pre-commit hooks, they will ensure code quality. If you don't do it the automated test running on the Pull Request will fail.

    pre-commit install && pre-commit install -t pre-push

Make your changes in the package definition files located in the `ccsds.packets.europa_clipper` directory.

Create/Update the test reference data as needed, next to the updated packet definitions, for example `ccsds.packets.europa_clipper.ecm.test`.

Run the tests to ensure everything is working:

    pytest


Before committing your changes update the poetry lock file:

    poetry lock
